How to install Python 2.7.9 on Ubuntu 14.04

First, install some dependencies:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev

Then download using the following command:
cd ~/Downloads/
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/Python-2.7.9.tgz

Extract and go to the dirctory:
tar -xvf Python-2.7.9.tgz
cd Python-2.7.9

Now, install using the command you just tried:
./configure


Global Install through pip
If you wish to install the latest version of Django globally, a better option is to use pip, the Python package manager. First, we need to install the pip package manager. Refresh your apt package index:

sudo apt-get update
Now you can install pip. If you plan on using Python version 2, install using the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
If, instead, you plan on using Python 3, use this command:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
Now that you have pip, we can easily install Django. If you are using Python 2, you can type:

sudo pip install django
If you are using Python 3, use the pip3 command instead:

sudo pip3 install django
